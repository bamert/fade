fade - fast adaptive stereo estimation 
===

Implements the semi-dense stereo method *High-Performance and Tunable Stereo Reconstruction* by Sudeep Pillai, Srikumar Ramalingam, 
John J Leonard, ICRA 2016
 
For sparse matches, the [openGPC implementation](https://github.com/bamert/openGPC) of the Global Patch Collider is used.

# Requirements
- Eigen3
- libpng
- CMake >= 3.4
- Sintel Stereo or Optical Flow datasets (http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/stereo).
This is only required if you would like to retrain a forest with different parameters.
Example forests are provided in the repository in the `forests` directory.

# Build
This is a header-only library and does not require building. 
The following instructions show how to build the examples contained in the directory `samples`.
Assuming we are within the root directory of the cloned repository:

```
cd samples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
```
The source code heavily relies on SSE instructions, which are enabled by default.
To build on another target platform such as ARM, supply the `SSE=OFF` argument to cmake, i.e.
use `cmake -DSSE=OFF ..` instead of the above `cmake ..`.

# Downloading datasets
If you'd like to train with either of the Sintel datasets, please refer to
`downloadSintelOpticalFlow.sh` and `downloadSintelStereo.sh` in the `data` directory.
These scripts will download and unpack the respective datasets. Please note
that both of these downloads are large (2 and 5GB)

# Running the examples
All examples have default parameters and run out of the box. Upon calling
the executables without arguments, usage information is displayed.

- `extract`: Mines a dataset from the Sintel dataset and stores it in an intermediary 
binary format. **Requires** the OpticalFlow dataset to be present (see section above)
- `train`: Trains a forest based on the dataset mined with `extract`.
**Requires** a previously extracted dataset, produced by extract
- `sparsematch`: Sparse matching based on pretrained forest. Outputs disparity estimate
to the build directory.
- `fade-estimate`: Semi-dense interpolation. Outputs disparity estimate to the build directory.
